#CodeRPG
**Origin:** This was originally a project for the 2019 HackRPI hackathon, in which we successfully created this discord bot that could run a users Python inputs and compare it to predetermined output. The creation of this bot was an incredible experience, and even ended up winning a Wolfram Award at HackRPI.

**What inspired us:** We are all active users of Discord, and know how large the user base is. We thought that creating a chat bot "RPG" to teach people with little-to-no coding experience Python would be fun, and that it could get people to try out programming and be more interested in computer science.

**What we learned:** None of us had prior experience in Javascript coming into this project, so we had to familiarize ourselves with the language in order to create this Discord bot. We all had little to no experience with GitHub prior to this project as well, and had to learn how to use Git to transfer all our code between computers.

**Challenges we faced:** In this project, we take user-input Python code and return whether or not the user is correct in solving the problem. In order to do this, we had to write their input message into a Python file, execute the file, and get the output back into our program- which is coded in Javascript. Needless to say we had a lot of trouble with this, especially since we didn't know any Javascript coming into this project, but after a lot of debugging we eventually got this to work.

**Moving forward:** We plan to continue with this project, although much more slowly than during HackRPI as school is a priority. We will occasionally push improvements and more levels to the bot, and are looking into hosting the bot on a reliable cloud service.
